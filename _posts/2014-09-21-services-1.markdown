  Nothing delights me more than a beautiful peice of software that makes someone's life easier.  I have shipped five enterprise products, working closely with development and design teams.  I am familiar with both Agile and Waterfall approaches.  I provide value through strategy, communication, planning, requirements management, process design, testing, and training.
