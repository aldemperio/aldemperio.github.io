  Nothing delights more happy than a beautiful peice of software that makes someone's life easier.  I have shipped five enterprise products, working closely with development and design teams.  I am familiar with both Agile and Waterfall approaches to SDLC.  I provide value through communication, planning, analysis, process design and training.
