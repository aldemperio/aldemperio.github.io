  I studied marketing at Northeastern University, and began my career in Voice of the Customer research.  I am insatiably curious about people, and have a unique ability to translate what people say and do into meaningful data.  I have helped brand teams in tech, finance, healthcare, and consumer goods create effective strategies and campaigns.
  
I love costume design.  I dabble in graphic art.  I blogged while on a 13,000-mile roadtrip the [Al's Epic Roadtrip](http://alisondemperio.blogspot.com/) <---this was was route.
