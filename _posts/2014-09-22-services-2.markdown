  Background in market research.  Success in developing and executing research projects for technology, health care, and consumer goods companies including Samsung, Intel, Boston Scientific, Roche International, and Spotify.  
Creative pursuits continue outside of the office.  I love costume design.  I dabble in graphic art.  I blogged while on a 13,000 mile summer roadtrip the [Al's Epic Roadtrip](http://alisondemperio.blogspot.com/).
