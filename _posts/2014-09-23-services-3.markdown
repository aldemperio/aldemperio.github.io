I travelled to China with my MBA classmates for an immersive business course; then brought this knowledge to my internship with Chrysler, where I developed product strategy for expansion into China.  I constantly see opportunities for growth; and I love communicating across cultures.  Language proficieny (ILR scale): English-5; ASL-3; Mandarin-2.
