My MBA from Thunderbird has given me invaluable skills in international strategy.  I travelled to China with my classmates for an immersive Chinese Business experience.  During my internship with Chrysler I developed product strategy for expansion into China.  I constantly see opportunities for growth.    
I am drawn to diversity, and thrive in cross-cultural communications.
